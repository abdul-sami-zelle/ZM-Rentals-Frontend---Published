        <p>
          When you rent a car in Auckland, the last thing you want to think about is breakdowns, scratches, or unexpected bills. Driving in a new city means new roads, new conditions, and sometimes, surprises that can quickly disrupt your plans. That’s where car rental insurance comes in.
        </p>
        <p className='global-content-style'>
          Think of it as your peace-of-mind passenger, sitting right beside you to keep your journey stress-free. From small dents and fender-benders to more serious mishaps, insurance protects both your wallet and your holiday. Instead of worrying about “what if,” you can focus on enjoying the road ahead, knowing support is always close by.

That’s why we include a basic protection package with every rental.

          <h3 className='global-heading-style'>Assess Before You Decide</h3>

          <p className='global-content-style'>
            You may never need to use rental insurance in Auckland, but when you do, it can save you from significant costs and stress. Whether you’re tackling winding mountain roads or navigating busy traffic, knowing you’re fully covered makes the journey more enjoyable.
          </p>
          <p className='global-content-style'>
            Before upgrading, it’s smart to check what you already have. Some personal car insurance policies, travel insurance plans, or even credit cards include rental car protection. However, in New Zealand, these often come with exclusions, such as limits on rental duration, vehicle types, or geographic coverage. Credit card protection may also act as secondary coverage, meaning it only applies after your primary insurance.
          </p>
          <p className='global-content-style'>
            The goal isn’t to double up; it’s to avoid gaps. By taking a few minutes to review your options, you can choose coverage that fits your trip, your route, and your budget. That way, the only thing you’ll need to focus on is making memories, not managing mishaps.
