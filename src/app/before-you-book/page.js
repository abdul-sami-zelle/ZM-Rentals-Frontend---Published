Let's walk through everything you need to know to make the best choice for your travels.

        <div className='before-you-book-requirments'>
          <h2 className='global-heading-style'>What You'll Need to Rent</h2>
          <p className='global-content-style'>
            Before you fall in love with that perfect vehicle, make sure you have everything required for a successful rental. You must be at least 21 years old to rent, and for international travelers, they should have an International Driving Permit alongside their home country's valid driver's license. Moreover, these documents are a must:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li className='global-content-style'>Valid driver's license (held for at least one year)</li>
            <li className='global-content-style'>Major credit card in the primary driver's name</li>
            <li className='global-content-style'>International Driving Permit (for non-domestic licenses)</li>
            <li className='global-content-style'>Proof of insurance (if declining rental coverage)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 className='global-heading-style'>Credit Card Considerations</h2>
        <p className='global-content-style'>
          Your credit card is more than just a payment method; it's your security deposit and often your insurance lifeline. We require a major credit card with sufficient available credit to cover the estimated rental cost plus a security hold, typically ranging from $200-$500, depending on the vehicle class.
        </p>


        <h2 className='global-heading-style'>Timing Is Everything</h2>
        <p className='global-content-style'>
            The sweet spot for booking rental cars is typically 3 to 6 months in advance, especially for peak travel seasons or special events. Weekday rentals, particularly Tuesday and Wednesday pickups, often offer better rates than weekend bookings. However, if you need a specific vehicle type like a minivan for a family reunion or a convertible for that dream coastal drive, book even earlier to ensure availability.

        <div className='before-you-book-requirments'>
            <h2 className='global-heading-style'></h2>
            <ul>
              <li className='global-content-style'>Compare prices across different pickup times; even a few hours can affect daily rates.</li>
              <li className='global-content-style'>Avoid booking pickup times earlier than necessary, as you'll be charged for a full day even if you only need the car for a few hours.</li>
              <li className='global-content-style'>Consider alternative pickup locations if you’re on a budget, as airport locations often carry premium surcharges.</li>
              <li className='global-content-style'>Join our exclusive newsletter before booking to unlock loyalty rewards and member-exclusive rates.</li>
            </ul>

        <div className='before-you-book-requirments'>
          <h2 className='global-heading-style'>Choosing the Right Vehicle</h2>
          <p className='global-content-style'>
            Think beyond just passenger capacity. Consider your luggage, planned activities, and driving conditions. That compact car might seem economical until you realize you're driving through rugged terrain with four large suitcases. Our vehicle categories are designed to match real travel scenarios:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li className='global-content-style'>
              <strong>Economy/Compact: </strong>Perfect for city exploration and solo travelers 
            </li>
            <li className='global-content-style'>
              <strong>Mid-size/Full-size: </strong>Ideal for longer trips with comfort and trunk space
            </li>
            <li className='global-content-style'>
              <strong>SUV/Crossover: </strong>Great for families, outdoor adventures, or challenging terrain
            </li>
            <li className='global-content-style'>
              <strong>Premium/Luxury: </strong>When your journey deserves something special
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 className='global-heading-style'>Preparation for Success</h2>
        <p className='global-content-style'>
          Confirm your reservation 24-48 hours before pickup and verify the location's operating hours. You can use our digital check-in options and real-time updates. And if your plans change, most reservations can be modified up to 24 hours before pickup.
        </p>

        <h1 className='section-main-heading'>Special Situations</h1>

        <h2 className='global-heading-style'>Additional Drivers</h2>
        <p className='global-content-style'>
          Adding authorized drivers to your rental agreement ensures everyone can share driving responsibilities legally and safely. Additional drivers must meet the same age and license requirements as the primary renter and be present during pickup with proper documentation.
        </p>
        <h2 className='global-heading-style'>Equipment and Accessibility</h2>
        <p className='global-content-style'>
          Planning to travel with little ones? Our child safety seats meet all federal safety standards and are professionally cleaned between rentals. Need GPS navigation, ski racks, or mobility equipment? Reserve these items in advance as availability can be limited, especially during peak travel periods.
        </p>

        <p className='global-content-style'>
          You're now equipped with insider knowledge to make the smartest rental car decision. Remember, the best deals and vehicles go to those who plan ahead, so don't wait to secure your perfect ride. Your Auckland adventure starts with a single click. Let's make it unforgettable.
